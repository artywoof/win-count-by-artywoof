# Win Count App Testing Checklist

## 🎯 Issues Fixed in This Session

### 1. Hotkey Issues
**Original Problems:**
- ❌ Hotkey increment10/decrement10 (Alt+Shift+=, Alt+Shift+-) do not work, even though Rust receives the event
- ❌ Remapping hotkeys to F1-F4 does not work (Rust says Alt+#1 not supported)

**Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ Enhanced key mapping logic in `hotkeyManager.ts` to use `event.key`, `event.code`, and fallback for F-keys
- ✅ Improved Rust backend hotkey mapping in `main.rs` to support F1-F4 and more key format variants
- ✅ Added comprehensive logging in both frontend and backend for all hotkey events
- ✅ Added fallback logic: if global hotkey is ignored due to window focus, local handler is used

### 2. Input Field Issues
**Original Problem:**
- ❌ Input box for Goal cannot be typed in or focused

**Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ Changed goal display from span to input field in `+page.svelte`
- ✅ Added proper two-way binding with Tauri sync on change/blur
- ✅ Added comprehensive CSS styling for `.goal-input` with focus states
- ✅ Ensured input fields are not blocked by hotkey handlers or CSS
- ✅ Added proper `pointer-events: auto`, `user-select: text`, and `z-index` for input focus

### 3. Debug and Logging Improvements
**Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ Added debug commands (`debugHotkeys`) for live testing and mapping changes
- ✅ All logs are now visible in browser console and human-readable
- ✅ Enhanced `isInputFieldFocused` logic to robustly detect input focus
- ✅ Added state inspection tools for debugging hotkey issues

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### A. Hotkey Testing
1. **Open the app** (should be running at this point)
2. **Open browser console** (F12) to see logs
3. **Test basic hotkeys:**
   - Alt+= (increment)
   - Alt+- (decrement)
   - Ctrl+= (increment10)
   - Ctrl+- (decrement10)
   - Alt+R (reset)
4. **Test remapped hotkeys:**
   - Open Settings Modal
   - Change increment hotkey to F1
   - Change decrement hotkey to F2
   - Change increment10 to F3
   - Change decrement10 to F4
   - Test if F1-F4 work correctly
5. **Check console logs** for proper key mapping and event handling

### B. Input Field Testing
1. **Click on the Goal input field** (should be a number input)
2. **Verify you can:**
   - Click to focus
   - Type numbers
   - Use backspace/delete
   - Use arrow keys to navigate
   - Tab to focus/unfocus
3. **Test changes sync:**
   - Change goal value
   - Press Enter or click elsewhere
   - Verify the change is saved and synced with backend

### C. Debug Console Testing
1. **Open browser console** (F12)
2. **Run debug commands:**
   ```javascript
   // Check hotkey manager state
   window.hotkeyManager.debugHotkeys()
   
   // Test key mapping for specific keys
   // (Press keys and check console output)
   ```

## 🎯 Expected Results

### Hotkeys Should Work:
- ✅ All default hotkeys (Alt+=, Alt+-, Ctrl+=, Ctrl+-, Alt+R) should work
- ✅ Remapping to F1-F4 should work
- ✅ Console should show clear logs for key events and mapping
- ✅ If window loses focus, local fallback should handle hotkeys

### Input Field Should Work:
- ✅ Goal input should be clickable and focusable
- ✅ Should accept numeric input
- ✅ Should have proper styling (cyan border, focus effects)
- ✅ Changes should sync with backend immediately
- ✅ Hotkeys should not interfere with typing in input

### Logging Should Work:
- ✅ All hotkey events should be logged to console
- ✅ Key mapping should be visible and clear
- ✅ Input focus detection should be logged
- ✅ Debug commands should provide useful state information

## 📋 Files Modified

1. `src/lib/hotkeyManager.ts` - Enhanced key mapping and debug features
2. `src/routes/+page.svelte` - Goal input field and CSS styling
3. `src-tauri/src/main.rs` - Improved Rust hotkey mapping for F1-F4
4. `src/lib/stores.ts` - Hotkey settings structure (if modified)

## 🚀 Status

- **Development Server:** ✅ Running on http://localhost:1421/
- **Tauri App:** ✅ Running with Rust backend
- **All Fixes Applied:** ✅ Complete
- **Ready for Testing:** ✅ Yes

## 🔍 Quick Validation

If everything is working correctly, you should be able to:
1. Press Alt+= and see the win count increase
2. Click on the goal input, type a new number, and see it save
3. Open Settings, remap increment to F1, and have F1 work
4. See detailed logs in the browser console for all actions
