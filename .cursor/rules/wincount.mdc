description: You are a lead solutions architect and senior full-stack developer, acting as a panel of experts: a Rust/Tauri backend specialist, a Svelte/TypeScript frontend developer, a cybersecurity expert, and a product monetization strategist. Your collective expertise covers creating secure, high-performance, lightweight desktop applications, specifically using the Tauri, Rust, Svelte, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Bun stack. You have deep, practical experience implementing robust anti-piracy measures, custom licensing systems, payment gateway integration (Gumroad, PromptPay), and real-time data synchronization between the backend and frontend.

I need you to create a comprehensive architectural plan and detailed development roadmap for a new desktop application named "Win Count by ArtYWoof". The application is a real-time counter for streamers to display on their live broadcasts (e.g., via TikTok LIVE Studio).

Think through this project step-by-step, explaining your reasoning for key architectural choices, highlighting potential challenges, and providing concrete code structure examples where necessary.

Project Vision & Core Philosophy:



Target Audience: Live streamers, categorized into two groups based on income and needs.

Core Values: The app must be extremely fast, lightweight, resource-efficient, and difficult to reverse-engineer or pirate.

Monetization Strategy: A Freemium model with a 7-day trial, a one-time purchase "Pro" version, and a subscription-based "Premium Live" version.

Detailed Requirements & Development Phases

Please break down your response into the following phases, addressing every point in detail.

Phase 1: Core Application (Backend: Rust/Tauri, Frontend: Svelte/TS)



Window & Chrome:

Implement a fixed-size window of 496x796 pixels.

The window must be undecorated (no default Windows/macOS title bar).

Create a custom, animated "rainbow border" around the application window.

Custom Buttons:

Minimize (-): On click, the window should animate into the system Taskbar.

Close (X): On click, the window should animate into the system Tray. The app must only be fully closable by right-clicking the Tray icon and selecting "Close". A single click on the Tray icon should restore the app window.

State Management & UI:

Preset Name: An editable text field at the top. Any changes must be auto-saved to the current preset's state immediately.

Win Counter:

Design a container holding a crown icon (ðŸ‘‘) and the win count number.

The number can range from -10,000 to 10,000.

Implement direct number input. If a user types a value outside the allowed range, trigger a visual feedback effect (e.g., a shake animation).

Goal Counter: A container with the text "à¹€à¸›à¹‰à¸²à¸«à¸¡à¸²à¸¢ (GOAL)" and a number input for the goal value, with the same range and validation as the Win Counter.

Preset Management:

A "Preset" button that opens a menu.

This menu must allow:

Adding a new preset (via a '+' icon), which prompts for a name.

Editing the name of existing presets.

Deleting presets.

Listing all created presets for selection.

Limit users to a maximum of 10 presets.

Switching presets must instantly update the UI with the selected preset's name, win count, and goal value.

Core Logic & Hotkeys (Rust Backend):

Implement global hotkeys that work even when the app is not in focus.

Alt + -: Decrement win count by 1.

Alt + =: Increment win count by 1.

Alt + Shift + -: Decrement win count by 10.

Alt + Shift + =: Increment win count by 10.

Every hotkey press or manual number change must trigger a customizable sound effect.

Auto-Save: All state changes (win count, goal, preset name) must be saved to disk instantly and automatically. Explain the best way to handle this frequent file I/O without performance loss.

Configuration & Settings:

Settings Menu: A dedicated page for settings.

Keybindings: Allow users to remap all hotkeys.

Audio: Provide options to disable sounds and to upload custom sound files (.mp3, .wav).

Overlay Link: A button to copy the local server URL for the overlay (e.g., http://localhost:1421/overlay.html).

Phase 2: Real-time Overlay (overlay.html)



Real-time Sync: The overlay must update instantly (zero perceived delay) whenever the win/goal count changes in the desktop app. Explain the best Tauri mechanism for this (Events, Commands).

Visual Structure:

A main container with a semi-transparent background. The page itself must have a fully transparent background for browser source embedding in OBS/TikTok LIVE Studio.

Display the crown icon.

Display the win count.

Display the goal count, formatted as /1000.

Dynamic Elements:

Visibility Toggles: The app must have switches to hide/show the crown icon and the goal display (/goal) on the overlay without hiding them in the main app UI.

Animations: Design visually appealing animations for number changes.

Conditional Coloring: Implement distinct colors/styles for negative numbers, zero, and positive numbers.

Extensibility: Structure the HTML/CSS to be highly customizable for future theming.

Phase 3: Security, Licensing & Anti-Piracy



This is the most critical section.

Anti-Reverse Engineering: Detail a multi-layered strategy to make the application extremely difficult to decompile, crack, or pirate. Given the Rust/Tauri stack, what specific techniques (code obfuscation, anti-tampering checks, etc.) should be used?

Licensing System:

Design a system that generates a unique Machine ID for each user's computer.

The license key should be tied to this Machine ID.

Outline the logic for online license validation upon app startup.

How will the app handle offline use after initial activation?

Differentiate the features available for the Pro (Buy-to-own) and Premium (Subscription) tiers within the same application binary.

Phase 4: Monetization & Payment Integration



Payment Flow (Credit/Debit):

Detail the integration process with Gumroad as the Merchant of Record.

Explain how to set up the webhook flow: Gumroad Payment Success -> Your Server -> Generate/Renew License Key -> Update Database -> User receives key.

Payment Flow (PromptPay QR):

Design the semi-automated flow:

App generates a PromptPay QR code with a unique reference number.

User pays and sends a screenshot of the slip + the reference number + their Machine ID to a Discord channel.

A Discord bot or admin verifies the payment and uses a command to trigger the license generation system.

Phase 5: Deployment & Maintenance



Custom Installer:

Configure the Tauri installer to allow users to select the installation directory.

The installer must automatically create a Win Count by ArtYWoof folder in the chosen root directory (e.g., if the user chooses D:\, it creates D:\Win Count by ArtYWoof).

Auto-Updater:

Configure Tauri's built-in updater to check for new versions against GitHub Releases.

Ensure the update process is seamless and automatic for the user.
